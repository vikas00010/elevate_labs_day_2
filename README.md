The **Student Record Management System** is a simple Java-based, command-line interface (CLI) application designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student records. It uses an ArrayList to store student objects, each containing fields like student ID, name, and marks. The system provides options to add new students, view all student records, update existing records based on student ID, and delete records. The application runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, offering an interactive and beginner-friendly way to manage student information efficiently through console inputs.
